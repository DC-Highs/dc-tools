# DC Tools

**DC Tools** is a tool developed by the [DC Highs team](https://github.com/dc-highs) - more specifically by the member [Marcuth](https://github.com/marcuth) - to perform static file search operations and search for data related to Dragon City in a more intuitive way, without having to manually build URLs and write parameters.
